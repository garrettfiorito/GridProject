 Garrett Fiorito CSS Grid+Media Query Project for SDEV106 -
 - I copy and pasted this code to Glitch and the output was unexpected. On a local port using VScode I was satisfied with the results of the live server output. 
 - In terms of the media query: I underestimated how tough this would be to do and ran out of time before perfecting the Header/Footer.
 - For future projects I need to manage my time better and start sooner to ensure I can work out issues and get the project fully polished.
